# Apricots-MW-NVG-VFX
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
This is the version currently uploaded to SteamWorkShop.
This version has been updated.
=======
Modified edition of ALPHA RELEASE addon.
MODERN WARFARE PHOSPHOR
This addon upgrades all NODs (NVGs) with white phosphor technology tubes that used in MODERN WARFARE.

SETUP:
This mod requires ACE3 and CBA_A3.
You can change phosphor tube in CBA setting listed under "Apricot's NVG VFX" with four types.
Green Phosphor (Default)	Addon's default. Green-Greens. aka-Disabled.
Hybrid	It's Green than MW type. My man say'd "this one is real!" but I'm not.
Modern Warfare	I think this one is real Modern Warfare Colorset. I like it.
White Phosphor	The Origin. Fat_Lurch's White Phosphor.
Servers can whitelist the addon but individual users can change and disable it if desired.
The mod has been tested in SP and on dedicated.
Works fine at client side.
Server key is available.

See youtube video that uploaded by BluFalconActual for explain.

Disclaimer:
This add-on was created based on the White Phosphor add-on by Fat_Lurch.
Therefore...
This mod conflict with Fat_Lurch's White Phosphor and NOD Colorize Addon series.
Use only one of them. If you doesn't, I don't care.

Work in Progress!
This mod is in Alpha release. Right now this overwrites the green hue of vehicle screens. Fat_Lurch will be developing more stringent code to detect these cases so that the white phosphor effect is only activated at appropriate times.

But I think he doesn't seem to have much time for this, so I'm working on my own version.
I'm working on this Git[github.com].
I would appreciate it if you could cooperate.

Known Issues:
Colour filter does not work when saving and loading a mission in progress.
May not work properly in vehicle night vision view.
If you were using NVGs before entering spectator mode (and the colour filter was working when you died), the colour filter will be applied in all states of spectator mode.
If ACE NVG is disabled, the expected colour tone is not achieved. (Because this add-on further modifies the ACE NVG tonal change. In other words, it is not the tint it is supposed to be in vanilla).

*No compatibility check with A3TI has been carried out.

Credits and Thanks:
