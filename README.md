[h1]Disclaimer:[/h1]
This add-on was created based on the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1792394837]White Phosphor[/url] add-on by [url=https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977538474/myworkshopfiles/?appid=107410]Fat_Lurch[/url].
Therefore...
This mod [b]conflict[/b] with Fat_Lurch's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1792394837]White Phosphor[/url] and [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1807445586]NOD Colorize Addon[/url] series.
[b]Use only one of them.[/b] If you doesn't, I don't care.

[h1]Work in Progress![/h1]
This mod is in Alpha release. Right now this overwrites the green hue of vehicle screens. Fat_Lurch will be developing more stringent code to detect these cases so that the white phosphor effect is only activated at appropriate times.

But I think he doesn't seem to have much time for this, so I'm working on my own version.
I'm working on [url=https://github.com/Apricot-ale/Apricots-MW-NVG-VFX]this Git[/url].
I would appreciate it if you could cooperate.

[h1]Known Issues:[/h1]
Colour filter does not work when saving and loading a mission in progress.
May not work properly in vehicle night vision view.
If you were using NVGs before entering spectator mode (and the colour filter was working when you died), the colour filter will be applied in all states of spectator mode.
If ACE NVG is disabled, the expected colour tone is not achieved. (Because this add-on further modifies the ACE NVG tonal change. In other words, it is not the tint it is supposed to be in vanilla).

*No compatibility check with A3TI has been carried out.
